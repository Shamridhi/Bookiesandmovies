            <h2>My POV</h2>
            <p>This book is a <span>gripping thriller</span>  that keeps readers on the edge of their seats. The plot is meticulously crafted to maintain a high level of intrigue, revolving around the concept,<span>"There are always two sides to a story."</span> </p>
            <p>I found the book far more enjoyable than the film adaptation, as it captures all the minute details that ignite the imagination and make readers feel like they are unraveling a mystery.</p><p> Each chapter <span>shifts the narrative and alters our perceptions</span> of the characters, making it seem like the pieces aren't fitting together at first. However, when the secret is finally revealed, it becomes clear just how clever the author is and how<span> masterfully the dots are connected.</span>
